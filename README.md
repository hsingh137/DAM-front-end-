# SMART FOOD

I built this application as one of my projects, during my time in LBS. 
It is a tool that you can use to plan your diet and grocery list. 

What it does is it asks you for your dietry reuqirements i.e. calories and allergens and, using linear programming, optimizes for the cheapest possible ingredients combination. 
The recipes and prices were scraped from hellofresh and sainsbury respectively. They 16,000 recipe-ingredients combinations were matched using BERT to to their prices and the model was built using gurobi.
The front end was built using react JS.
